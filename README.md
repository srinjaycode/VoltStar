# VoltStar Telemetry System

**VoltStar** is a real-time telemetry system designed to track vehicle performance using various sensors, including IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), GPS, and temperature sensors. The system uses LoRa modules to wirelessly transmit data to a Raspberry Pi, which is used for real-time analytics and monitoring.

## Features

- **IMU Sensor**: Tracks the vehicle's orientation (pitch, roll, yaw).
- **GPS Module**: Tracks location and calculates speed using the Haversine formula.
- **Temperature Sensors (DS18B20)**: Monitors temperature in critical components like the controller and batteries.
- **LoRa Modules**: Enables wireless data transmission to a Raspberry Pi for monitoring and analytics.
- **TFT Display**: Provides the driver with essential metrics like speed and alerts for exceeding speed limits.

## Collaboration on GitHub

Our team collaborated on **GitHub**, enabling:

- **Version Control**: We managed code changes, tracked versions, and ensured everyone was working with the most up-to-date code.
- **Remote Collaboration**: Team members worked from different locations, pushing updates and reviewing each other’s code through pull requests.
- **Efficient Workflow**: GitHub’s issue tracker and feature requests helped us stay organized and prioritize tasks.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
